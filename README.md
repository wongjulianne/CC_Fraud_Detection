# Introduction
Hi everyone, this is my portfolio where I upload my various data analysis, visualization, and machine learning projects. 

A little about me, I am a recent graduate from the University of Waterloo where I majored in Biotechnology and Economics. I have professional experience in Sales and Marketing data analysis, but I am looking to shift into data science and machine learning. Follow along my journey as I explore more methods in data and take on passion projects. 

Below are the projects included in this portfolio: 
1. [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/wongjulianne/ds_projects/tree/main/Fraud_Detection) - This project used categorical data analysis and machine learning to create a fraud detection model with 90% accuracy.
2. [NYC Real Estate Sales Analysis](https://github.com/wongjulianne/ds_projects/tree/main/NYC_Real_Estate_Sales) - This is a data cleaning and visualization project that looked at trends of real estate sales in New York from October 2022 to September 2023.
