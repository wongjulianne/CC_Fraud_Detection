# Overview
This project uses categorical data analysis and machine learning methods in Python to predict fraudulent credit card transactions. 

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhanushnarayananr/credit-card-fraud)

The different models explored in this project are:
- Logistic regression
- Shallow neural network
- Random forest
- Gradient boosting classifier
- Linear support vector machine classifier

The models were compared based on precision, recall, and f1-score.
