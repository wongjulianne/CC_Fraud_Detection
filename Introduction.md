Hi everyone, this is my portfolio where I upload my various data analysis, visualization, and machine learning projects. 

A little about me, I am a recent graduate from the University of Waterloo where I majored in Biotechnology and Economics. My previous professional experience has been in data analysis, but I am looking to shift into data science and machine learning. 
You can follow along on my journey here where I explore different methods in data. 

Below are the projects included in this portfolio: 
1. [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/wongjulianne/ds_projects/tree/main/Fraud_Detection) - Here, I used categorical data analysis and machine learning to create a fraud detection model with 90% accuracy.
